## Project Brief
The project is a multithreaded C++ email server compatible with Thundermail in linux<br/>
The system supports<br/>
:key:user sign-up/log-in<br/>
:email:mail write/send<br/>

## Architect
• USER, which tells the server which user is logging in;
• PASS, which specifies the user's password;
• STAT, which returns the number of messages and the size of the mailbox;
• UIDL, which shows a list of messages, along with a unique ID for each message;
• RETR, which retrieves a particular message;
• DELE, which deletes a message;
• QUIT, which terminates the connection;
• LIST, which shows the size of a particular message, or all the messages;
• RSET, which undeletes all the messages that have been deleted with DELE; and
• NOOP, which does nothing.

## Use
1. Go to the directories: ./smtp or ./pop3 and do: 
```bash 
make
```
2.
